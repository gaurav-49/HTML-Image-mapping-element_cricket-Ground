        <p>Steven Peter Devereux Smith (born 2 June 1989) is an Australian international cricketer and former captain of the Australian national team. Smith is consistently rated as one of the top-ranked Test batsmen in the world, according to the ICC Player Rankings. Smith has been called the "best since Bradman" due to his distinctively high Test batting average.[3] He plays for New South Wales and Sydney Sixers in domestic cricket. He is the captain of Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League.

		Although he was initially selected for Australia as a right-arm leg spinner, Smith later played primarily as a batsman. After a few matches in 2010 and 2011, he was a regular player in the Australian team after 2013, and took over captaincy from Michael Clarke in late 2015, after which he predominantly batted at number 3 or 4.</p>
