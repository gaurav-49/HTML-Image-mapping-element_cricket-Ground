        <p>Arguably New Zealand's finest batsman since the legendary Martin Crowe, Kane Williamson had been a wonder kid since his teenage days. His exceptional talent included the rare Non-Asian skill to play quality spin apart from being adept against fast bowling. It would be fair to say the Williamson family boasted of sports freak all around. While his father had played cricket at certain age groups, his mother was a fine basketball player and his sisters excelled in volleyball. It was therefore not a surprise when Kane took a liking to sports and it happened to be cricket.</p>
